### Problem %MDNS% %STATE% %IP% is changed in Editor Also

some template processing on upload webserver html files

on nerd.html bulb.html and bulbs.html 

%STATE% %MDNS% %IP%

but bit of a problem that 

it is also replaced in the ace editor 

if mdns adres is later changed in setup custom or in json

then the variables  %MDNS% %STATE% %IP% in html are not Changed

should exclude template processing for ace editor content
