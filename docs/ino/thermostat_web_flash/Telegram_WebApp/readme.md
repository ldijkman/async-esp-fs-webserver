Yes, you can enhance the interaction with your ESP8266-based IoT device 

by integrating a Telegram Web App. 

Telegram Web Apps are web pages that are configured to be displayed inside Telegram chats, 

allowing for more advanced and user-friendly interfaces, 

such as custom forms for inputting time or scheduling tasks.
