got it a bit working (my ESP32-CAM dust collectors for > 2 years)
- do not like the ftdi thingy, usb port shield might be a lot easier
- there was no mention of 5vcc, so thing keeps brownout rebooting after programming
- will wait for the ESP32-CAM usb port shields before i continue with this
- image size to large i think
